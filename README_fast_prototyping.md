# Fast Prototyping

**Fast Prototyping** (also known as **Rapid Prototyping**) is a development approach used to quickly create a working model or simulation of a product, system, or concept. It allows designers, engineers, and developers to test ideas, gather feedback, and iterate on designs early in the development process‚Äîbefore investing significant time and resources into full-scale production.

## üîç Key Characteristics

- **Speed over perfection**: The goal is to build something functional quickly, not perfect.
- **Iterative process**: Prototypes are refined through multiple cycles based on testing and feedback.
- **Low-cost materials/tools**: Often uses 3D printing, breadboards, mockups, or software frameworks.
- **User-centered**: Helps validate usability and functionality with real users early on.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Applications

- **Product design**: Creating physical models using 3D printers or CNC machines.
- **Software development**: Building wireframes, mock interfaces, or MVPs (Minimum Viable Products).
- **Electronics**: Using microcontrollers (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to test circuits and sensors.
- **UX/UI design**: Rapidly testing user flows and interface layouts.
